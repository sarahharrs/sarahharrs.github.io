This is the thought that drummed through my mind when I decided to enroll in the Flatiron School.  Hi, I'm Sarah Harrs: life long student, curious cat and inspiring cyber professional. Like most students enrolled, the story of how I got to Flatiron is quite unique. Historically speaking, I wasnâ€™t an A+ Math student but I do recall always wanting to understand how systems, items, organizations and people work and operate. Perhaps that's how I landed in business. I graduated from Virginia Tech with my bachelors and then continued on to Georgetown University for my masters.  I started out working in accounting and finance and over time I realized I wanted to help organizations with risk management and strategy.

In my professional career, I want to be the bridge between technology and business. Through that process I realized that my passion is information security. 
 
Once I realized my passion for information security, I tried to determine the skills  that I needed to acquire to become a high performing cyber security professional. I broke cyber into 3 main components that I will need to master:

1.	Networking 
2.	Systems Administration
3.	Programing

I realize programming will probably be the toughest component, so I am tackling this first through the Flatiron School. I recognize I need an intense program with a supportive community who also has the hunger to learn like I do. As security exploits are becoming more and more sophisticated, cyber professionals will need to have a thorough knowledge of programming and code to catch the black hats!

Although I have my north star aimed towards cyber security, I  am ultimately open minded.  I'm excited to learn about web development and I'm open to the possibility that I could even enjoy web development more than cyber security!  So far my favorite thing about code is that it's extremely technical whilst also extremely creative.  Personally, I would say that I am both left and right brained. I believe good coders have to exercise and tap both sides of their brain in order to create original and functional code.

Till next time!  <3
